**Planned Work:**  
- Create project folder and documentation structure.  
- Install Power BI Desktop & set up Power BI Service account.  
- Identify required dashboard pages.  

**Work Done:**  
- ✅ Created GitHub repository and added initial folder structure (`data/`, `docs/`, `visuals/`, `pbix/`).  
- ✅ Installed **Power BI Desktop** on local machine.  
- ✅ Drafted initial documentation file `ProjectBrief.md`.  
- ✅ Decided on 5 dashboard pages:  
  1. **Overview Dashboard** – summary of elections, parties, seat share.  
  2. **Geographical Map Dashboard** – state/constituency-wise results.  
  3. **Trends Dashboard** – vote share trends, turnout, past vs current comparisons.  
  4. **Candidate Dashboard** – individual candidate profiles, performance, margins.  
  5. **Media Dashboard** – simplified, broadcast-ready view with key highlights.  

**Issues Faced:**  
- None today. Setup went smoothly.
